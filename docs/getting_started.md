# Getting started

If you achieve Gissmo installation, good job!

Access to Gissmo admin interface with your fresh superuser. It's time to create some data.

## Needed data

To manipulate equipments and interventions on sites, create these elements:

  * projects and permissions for each one
  * user (linked to projects)
  * equipment supertypes
  * equipment types
  * equipment models
  * organisms
  * sites

This should be enough.
