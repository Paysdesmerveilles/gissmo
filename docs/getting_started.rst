Getting started
***************

If you achieve Gissmo installation, good job!

As you created the superuser, you access admin interface. It's time to create some data.

In brief
========

If you're comfortable with Django admin interface, you could create quickly these elements:

  * projects and permissions for each one
  * user (linked to projects)
  * equipment supertypes
  * equipment types
  * equipment models
  * sites

After that, you would be able to create equipments and interventions on sites.

.. todo::

   * Explain how django admin interface works (like that: http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter06.html)
   * Explain for each object (as previously listed) for what it have been designed and how to create/use it.

   For an example: A project aims to manage permissions and access to each other objects for user that have been added on it.
