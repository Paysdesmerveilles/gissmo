# Gissmo

Gissmo aims to be a web management system for tagged equipments located on some places, especially in seismological stations. It gives information about how to access data on each station via a RESTful API.

Gissmo is used by seismological french network ([RESIF](http://www.resif.fr/)).

# Overview

Gissmo is based on [Django](http://djangoproject.com/) to display a web interface and a RESTful API.

It manages users, projects and assembles equipments by model and type.

With Gissmo you can:

  * add IP addresses and services on each equipment
  * create a data acquisition chain by using channel concept
  * keep an history of intervention that occurs on equipments and stations
  * generate a [StationXML file](http://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/) for each station
  * display stations map
  * visualize your station on Google Map
  * create default equipment configuration and use it as default for each channel
  * attach documents on station, intervention, equipments and models
  * create 3 channels in a one-step wizard for a given station
  * and moreâ€¦

Gissmo is designed for seismology. But it is useful in case you manage location with a sheet of paper or a spreadsheet.
